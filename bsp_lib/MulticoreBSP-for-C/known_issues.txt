Known issues (since version 2.0.4):

- various utility functions that increase
  capacity may deadlock if the target size
  is more than half of SIZE_MAX.

- BSMP hpmove may fail on non-Intel
  architectures due to not aligning payloads
  on int boundaries. Thanks to Wijnand
  J. Suijlen (Huawei) for reporting!

- Unable to build shared libraries when
  cross-compiling for Windows. Please issue
  `make library' to (successfully) build the
  static version only.

Known issues (since version 2.0.3):

- when compiling on OS X using GCC, you may
  need to replace `native' with `corei7' for
  each of the -march / -mtune flags. This is
  a GCC bug.

- the automatically generated benchmark plots
  in benchmarks/plot_results (by executing
  cd benchmarks && make) cannot be properly
  plotted by Octave 4.2.2 due to a bug in its
  `legend' built-in script. (MATLAB works.)
  
- when compiling with Clang prior to version
  4.0, (harmless) warnings will be displayed.
